# MapIt

A simple Django based web app that  that enables a user to 
search for a location and find the same on a map.


This project provided me with an opportunity to learn Django as well as retrieving data from APIs.
I was completely new to all these tools and frameworksÂ prior to working on this project, and I learnt a lot
about them.

### Tech Stack
- Django
- Crispy-Forms (Django)
- Folium API
- GeoCoder API
- HTML and CSS


### Features

- Marks the searched location (city, country, etc) on the map using longitude and latitude coordinates
- Finds the country where the place is situated and displays it on a label in the language of that country
- Redirects to error page upon searching for an incorrect location

### Currently working on

- Beautifying the website (Very basic at the moment)
- Fixing the error for empty database
- Adding extra map functionalities 
- Converting the error page to an alert/pop up
